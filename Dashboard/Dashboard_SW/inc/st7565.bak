 * @details
 *
 * A library for using the ST7565 graphic LCD in serial (software SPI) mode.
 *
 * This library is a low-level interface to the screen only.  Graphics functions (text, images
 * etc) are separate.
 *
 * Each screen requires different settings for brightness (the "volume control" and internal
 * resistor settings).  The initialisation code picks a middle ground, but you may need to 
 * modify this.
 *
 * In serial mode it is not possible to read data back from the screen, meaning we
 * need an array to hold the current data.  For a 128*64 screen, this will require
 * 1KiB of RAM.  We need to know what data is currently on the screen so that we can overlay
 * new pixels onto it, so must keep a copy in local memory.
 * 
 * SPI timings have been checked using the MPLAB Simulator, with Vcc of 3.3v it is impossible 
 * to violate the datasheet guidelines even up to 64Mhz.
 *
 * This code has been tested on a PIC 18F26K20 at 64Mhz using the internal PLL.  No
 * adverse effects were noticed at this speed.  You will need the HiTech delay routines
 * or an equivalent.
 *
 * Example usage (initialisation):
 * @code
 *    // Initialise the screen, turning it on
 *    glcd_init();
 *
 *    // Clear the screen's internal memory 
 *    glcd_blank();
 *
 *    // Set the screen's brightness, if required.  See below for information
 *    // on how this works.
 *    glcd_contrast(3, 25);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example usage (writing to the screen):
 * @code
 *    // Set some pixels in the RAM buffer
 *    glcd_pixel(1, 1, 1);
 *    glcd_pixel(2, 1, 1);
 *    glcd_pixel(1, 2, 1);
 *    glcd_pixel(2, 2, 1);
 *
 *    // Clear a pixel in the RAM buffer
 *    glcd_pixel(64, 64, 0);
 *
 *    // Copy the RAM buffer to the screen
 *    glcd_refresh();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note This is a low level library only, with support for setting & clearing pixels.  For text 
 * or graphics functions, please see my graphics library.
 * 
 * This code is released under the BSD license.  Please see BSD-LICENSE.TXT for more information.
 *
 * @todo Check timings compared to datasheet, supply a max recommended Fosc.
 * @todo Handle different sized screens if appropriate, e.g. 128*32 (some code is still
 *       fixed to certain screen/page sizes).
